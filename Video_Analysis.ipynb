    "This Python script utilizes Google Gemini, a multimodal LLM (Large Language Model), to analyze a video and identify scene changes, specifically focusing on detecting potential points for ad insertion. The script prompts Gemini to select the 10 most suitable scene transitions across the video, distributing them throughout the beginning, middle, and end. These points are chosen to minimize interruptions for viewers and ensure optimal ad placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gemini model provides metadata for each identified scene change, including the timestamp, reason for the scene change, summary, transition type, narrative role, dialogue intensity, and character types. This metadata is returned in a consistent JSON structure, thanks to Gemini's controlled output feature, making it suitable for downstream processing without additional transformations. The script converts this structured JSON response into a Pandas DataFrame for storage in a database like BigQuery for future analysis."
